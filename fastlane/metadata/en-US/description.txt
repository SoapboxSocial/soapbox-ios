Soapbox is a different take
Good conversations don’t need good lighting. Rooms have the same feeling as chatting with someone in a coffeeshop or a bar; hop in and hop out of conversations and bond over topics and common interests. We’re an inclusive and friendly community. 

Make new friends
Create a public room and make new friends. Anyone can hop into your room. Follow your new friends and be notified when they start or join rooms.

Talk about anything
Create a group for your closest friends; rooms created in that group will only let your friends join. Join or create public groups for your favorite topics or technologies, and everyone who joins the group will be notified when you’re talking.

Talk in private
Want some privacy? Or want to have a business chat? Create a private room and invite your colleague or friends to talk. Your friends won’t be notified unless you invite them and the room won’t show up publicly.
