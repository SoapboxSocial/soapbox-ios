A FRIENDLY AND CASUAL DROP-IN SPACE

Soapbox Rooms are like chatting with someone in a coffee shop or a bar; hop in and hop out of conversations and bond over topics and common interests. We’re an inclusive and friendly community. 

MEET NEW PEOPLE WITH RELAXED AUDIO ROOMS

Create a public room and make new friends. Anyone can hop into your room. Follow your new friends and get notified when they start or join rooms.

CHAT AND PLAY YOUR FAVORITE GAMES WITH FRIENDS.

Conversations are even better when you’re playing games together. We've got some of your favorite games like Flap with Friends, Draw with Friends, Trivia, Polls and more.

SHARE YOUR REACTIONS WITH EMOJIS!

Add emotion to your conversations by reacting with emojis in real-time.  

POST HOW YOU’RE DOING WITH A VOICE STORY

You let friends know how you’re doing by posting a voice story. 

SHARE A LINK, VIDEO, SONG AND MORE — SOAPBOX IS ALL ABOUT SHARING

We make it easy to share the things you're interested in. Share videos, songs and links to the room. Want something to stick around longer? Pin them to watch a video together or play music in the background while chatting.
